# dijikstra_python_O-ElogV-
using custom made min heap that uses keys and values and positions dynamically
 please go through the code . most of the implementations found in github are ExE complexicity approaches but here i gave a better complexicity od Exlog(V) but you can still reduce the complexicity using fibonacci heaps as or min heap for implementing priority Queue that would reduce our Complexicity to Vxlog(V)+E ammortized time
 I will try to implment using fibonacci heaps in next repository
